## 1. Mission Statement
Our mission is to provide arcade gaming interfaces that are unique, immersive and en-joyable to our users.  These interfaces will provide a more realistic and exciting experiencethrough  unique  physical  interaction.   There  are  few  organizations  who  implement  similartechnologies.  Unlike these organizations, we aim to make an affordable arcade product witha unique immersive experience
